A GIS-based map-matching algorithm is used to derive users' routes along the cycling network within Hamilton, Ontario and generate multiple attributes for each route, such as route distance, route directness, average distance between intersections, and the number of turns, intersections, and unique road segments. Concerning route choice analysis, the origin and destination pair should be the same for all routes within a choice set, thus HBS users' trips are grouped by origin-destination hub pairs. Since trips taken by different users between a hub pair can follow the same route, unique routes are extracted using a link signature extraction tool. Following this, a normalized Gini (Gn) coefficient is calculated for each hub pair to evaluate users' preferences among all the unique hub-to-hub route choices. A Gn closer to 0 indicates that routes between a hub pair are more evenly used, while a value closer to 1 implies a higher preference toward one dominant route. Three route choice models, a global model, a medium Gn model, and a high Gn model, are estimated using Path-Size Logit to determine how route choice is affected by the presence of dominant routes. These models suggest that HBS users are willing to detour for some attributes, such as bicycle facilities, but tend to avoid circuitous routes, turns, steep slopes, and roads with high traffic volume.},

Objective We describe the design, measures and baseline characteristics of a bikeshare evaluation designed to assess within-person changes in physical activity levels (PA) and focused particularly on persons with lower socio-economic status. Methods 1206 Philadelphians enrolled in the evaluation during 2015\textendash 2017 and completed an internet survey. Past 7-day work, transport, and leisure-time PA were collected. Participants were linked to their bikeshare trips in order to objectively assess program use. Results Survey participants were 41\% non-White; 33\% lower-socio-economic status (`disadvantaged'); main transportation mode was split between motor vehicle, public transit, and walking; 43\% had never been on a personal bicycle in the city; and only 6\% primarily traveled via bicycle. After excluding walking, 45\% were insufficiently active (lower levels of moderate or vigorous PA based on minimum guidelines). Relative to others, those who were insufficiently active were disproportionately older, female, non-Hispanic Black and disadvantaged. Adjusted baseline results found much higher prevalence of insufficient activity among disadvantaged persons and persons primarily traveling via public transit or motor vehicle (relative to walking or cycling). Conclusions The evaluation successfully enrolled a diverse cohort of new bikeshare members. The two-year evaluation will assess changes in biking and total activity levels, focusing on disadvantaged persons and those with insufficient activity at baseline.},

We discuss how further system expansion and utilization by residents in high-poverty communities of color could affect the potential benefit of the largest bicycle share system in the United States. Methods First, we compared the Citi Bike station distribution by census tract poverty during the system's 2013 launch and after the 2015 geographic expansion. Second, we applied the World Health Organization's Health Economic Assessment Tool (HEAT) to estimate the benefit of cycling associated with annual Citi Bike members for two 12-month time periods and analyzed change of the benefit over time. Results The results showed that the greatest proportion of Citi Bike stations were located in low-poverty (wealthier) NYC census tracts (41\% per period), and there were no significant changes in station distribution during expansion. HEAT estimated an increase from two to three premature deaths prevented and an increased annual economic benefit from \$18,800,000 to \$28,300,000 associated with Citi Bike use. Conclusion In conclusion, although Citi Bike stations are not equitably located, the estimated annual health benefits are substantial and have increased over time. Our findings underscore the potential for even greater benefits with increased spatial access in higher-poverty neighborhoods and communities of color. Our findings highlight the importance of the built environment in shaping health and the need for a health equity lens to consider the social and political processes that perpetuate inequities.},

Over 1.6 million Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates of bikeshare trips over a period of four months were used to identify the routes most frequently used by bikers. It was hypothesized that potential new bike station locations have a relationship with proximity to transit, attractions and restaurants/pubs. A negative correlation was found between route usage intensity and proximity to attractions and restaurants/pubs, which means that the closer the proximity to attractions or restaurants/pubs, the higher the road usage intensity is. A new methodology was developed by modifying Huff's gravity model, replacing facility location size with a suitability score. The bike station suitability score is calculated with regard to proximity to transit, attractions, restaurants/pubs and existing bike stations. A location allocation model is developed to maximize market share, i.e., the potential bike station locations will be accessible to maximum population while also being within a 400-m (0.25-mile) radius of attractions, restaurants/pubs and at least 300 m from existing bike stations. The location of the proposed bike stations through location allocation is within a block of the planned bike stations by the City of Baltimore, which corroborates the findings of this study. This methodology will be useful to identify new facility locations in any metropolitan city where maximum exposure is a necessity.},

Smart bikeshare is increasingly seen as complicit in processes of social stratification, serving a predominately white, middle-class demographic and particular locales. Our case study reveals the potential of reflexive design praxes to reconfigure bikeshare as a platform for both instrumental and social value. In particular, we highlight how collaborative, open and inclusive forms of urban governance can enroll a broad range of civic actors to create a scheme that embodies diverse but complimentary goals and ideologies. We conclude that instrumentalization theory provides a conceptual means to open up the ``black box'' of urban design to critical interrogation, and to identify how to enact participatory design and citizen-centric smart urbanism.},

Despite the increase in systems and users, little is known about how bikeshare member demographics and travel patterns compare with those of traditional bicyclists. To bridge the gap, this study investigated bikeshare system user travel behavior and developed a profile of user demographics through the comparison of short-term (1 day) users and annual members of Capital Bikeshare (CaBi) in Washington, D.C., with profiles of area bicyclists. Data originated from a Washington, D.C., regional household travel survey of 2007\textendash 2008, an intercept survey of short-term CaBi users, and an online survey of annual CaBi members. The analysis compared gender, race and ethnicity, age, and student status, as well as socioeconomic status across the surveys. The comparison included trip purpose, helmet use, and travel modes for trips that were replaced by bikesharing. Profiles of CaBi and area cyclists differed with respect to many demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Compared with area cyclists, CaBi short-term users and annual members were more likely to be female and younger, to have lower household incomes, and to own fewer cars and fewer bicycles and were more likely to cycle for utilitarian purposes. CaBi trips mainly replaced trips made by public transport and by walking. CaBi short-term users and members shared similar characteristics, but short-term users were more likely to ride for recreational purposes and were less likely to wear a helmet. The study results indicated that bikesharing can encourage new segments of society to cycle and can help increase the bicycling mode share overall.},

Using data from a survey of bike-share users in Dublin, Ireland, we critically examine the relative value of these benefits and their impact on the spatial functioning of cities. We demonstrate that, for this particular scheme, the benefits associated with time savings far exceed the benefits that are commonly claimed for modal transfer. We go on to describe how, by delivering time savings and improving spatial connectivity, bike-share schemes reduce effective density and supply both conventional and wider economic benefits for the urban economy that are commensurate with investment in public transport schemes. Finally, we show how investment in the Dublin bike-share scheme has a positive benefit-cost ratio that exceeds estimates based on a more restricted appraisal.},

Some methodologies that maximise coverage or accessibility are suggested in the literature. In this paper, we propose a bike-sharing stations location model that includes not only these issues but also equality aspects. The model aims to minimise inequalities in bicycle-public transport mobility among observed population groups trying to maintain specified levels of accessibility and coverage at the same time. We evaluated the performance of the model on a test network and carried out a sensitivity analysis according to the available budget. The results showed that maximising accessibility or coverage alone, without considering equality, may lead to an unequal distribution of accessibility among the population, producing discrimination between different groups. The outcomes of the application revealed the significance of the model in evaluating equality in the network design phase for achieving not only a satisfactory bike-sharing system and public transport multimodal accessibility of each zone but also a high equality measure among the considered population groups. Budget availability also played an essential role since a minimum budget value is needed to achieve higher levels of equality. The proposed approach could serve transport and public authorities as a decision support system in planning future investment as well as promoting multimodal mobility because it links bike-sharing stations with stops/stations of the public transport lines networks.},

Experience from other cities in the US and elsewhere in the developed world suggest that bikeshare systems are used mostly by more affluent populations. In order to encourage more bikeshare usage among low-income populations, the City of Philadelphia sited docking stations in low-income neighborhoods, allowed cash payments, and provided discounts to those receiving food-stamps. We examined one-year of data for Philadelphia's Indego bikeshare system between April 2017 and March 2018. Travel patterns were examined and suggested that bikeshare trips taken from docking stations in lower-income areas are for work commute trips. Multivariate regression models confirmed that lower-income areas generate fewer trips while controlling for other factors such as transit access and whether the station is proximate to a bicycle lane. Our results suggest that despite Indego's efforts, more work is needed to generate bikeshare trips in lower income neighborhoods.},

  abstract = {The rising adoption of bike-sharing systems brings significant benefits to individuals and society as a whole. However, whether these benefits are distributed throughout society in a fair manner is still an open question. This study presents a methodological framework for assessing the equity performance of bike-sharing systems, with Coast Bike Share system in southern Tampa as a case study. The framework integrates three different datasets: bike-sharing infrastructure, individual travel itineraries and individual sociodemographic attribute data. With these datasets, we model individual accessibility to activity locations using bike-sharing as the mode of transportation by analyzing the ``walking-cycling-walking'' process of a bike-sharing trip and the trip-chaining behavior in individuals' travel itineraries. Further, a series of equity measures are used to analyze equity performance from the perspective of both horizontal and vertical equity. To assess horizontal equity, we apply the Lorenz curve, Gini index and mapped geographic differences. For vertical equity, we compare descriptive statistics by group, perform analysis of variance, and calculate the subgroup inequality index using disaggregated data. Results reveal that accessibility to bike-sharing is not evenly distributed among individuals in the population, within the geographic space, and among different sociodemographic groups of southern Tampa. Further, our results also highlight the need to incorporate high-resolution disaggregated data and tour-based analysis to address the equity performance of bike-sharing systems.},

  abstract = {Health care accessibility is a vital indicator for evaluating areas where there are medical shortages. However, due to the lack of population data with a satisfactory spatial resolution, efforts to accurately measure health care accessibility among older individuals have been hampered to some extent. To address this issue, we attempt to measure accessibility to health care services for older bus passengers in Nanjing, China, using a finer spatial resolution. More specifically, based on one month's worth of bus smart card data, a framework for identifying the home stations (i.e., a passenger's preferred station near their residence) of older passengers is developed to measure the aggregate demand at the bus stop scale. On this basis, a measurement that integrates the Gaussian two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) and the adjusted 2SFCA methods (referred to as the adjusted Gaussian 2SFCA method) is proposed to measure accessibility to health care services for older people. The results show that: (1) almost all home stations experience inflated demand, especially those located in the suburbs; (2) despite abundant health care resources, home stations in urban districts are rarely identified as high accessibility stations, due to high demand densities among the older population; and (3) more attention should be paid to two types of home stations \textendash{} those with a medical institution and those with bed shortages, respectively. The first type is predominantly distributed in the periphery of the city, in the suburbs where the travel time required to access the nearest health care service by bus is longer. The second type is mostly located in the outskirts of urban districts and in the central area of one suburb. These findings could help policy makers to implement more appropriate measures to design and reallocate health care resources.},

Existing statistical modeling approaches for transportation equity analysis have typically assumed that parameter estimates are constant across all observations and used data aggregated to certain geographic units for the analysis. Such methods cannot capture unobserved factors that are not contained in the dataset, i.e., unobserved heterogeneity, which is likely to be present in the increasingly popular disaggregated datasets. To investigate whether there is unobserved heterogeneity in transportation equity impacts, this study carries out an empirical study focusing on the distribution of individual accessibility to activity locations via bike-sharing in southern Tampa. A disaggregated dataset containing information on individual bike-sharing accessibility and socio-economic factors is modeled with a random parameters logit model that allows for the investigation of possible unobserved heterogeneity. Further, models are estimated using data aggregated to parcel- and TAZ-levels to explore the impacts of data aggregation on model estimation results. The models unveil the unobserved heterogeneity in bike-sharing accessibility among populations in different groups defined by different sociodemographic factors in southern Tampa. These results shed insights into how the inconsistent disparity direction of transportation outcomes across individuals in a population group can be measured from the heterogeneity effects. Finally, a comparison between different models show that to capture such inconsistency, the use of disaggregated data with heterogeneity models is highly recommended for transportation equity analysis.},

This work explores two significant issues related to FCA metrics. First, the Three Step Floating Catchment Area is critically examined. Next, the research shows that all FCA metrics contain an underlying assumption that supply locations are optimally configured to meet the needs of the population within the system. Because truly optimal configurations are highly unlikely in real-world health care systems, a modified two-step floating catchment area (M2SFCA) metric is offered to address this issue. The M2SFCA is built upon previous FCA metrics, but allows for spatial accessibility to be discounted as a result of the suboptimal configuration of health care facilities within the system. The utility of the new metric is demonstrated through simulated data examples and a case study exploring acute care hospitals in Michigan.},

  abstract = {Equity has been a major concern of public transport provision and is required by legislation in many countries. Several approaches measure equity in transit supply however none produce a simple system-wide measure of equity performance. A new approach is presented using Lorenz curves to measure the relative supply of transit to the population. Gini coefficients provide a single measure of overall equity using this method. A system-wide assessment of overall transit supply to the population in Melbourne, Australia shows that 70\% of the population shares only 19\% of the supply (Gini coefficient=.68). When employment is also taken into account, the situation is not much different; 70\% of jobs and population share 23\% of service (G=.62). In order to gain some understanding of vertical equity, the transit supply was compared between different age, income and vehicle ownership groups. There is some evidence of higher supply for youth and low-income groups in inner Melbourne, and in all parts of Melbourne no-vehicle households lived in areas of higher transit supply. Overall it is unclear how ``fair'' these distributions are compared to equity in other cities since this is the first time this method has been undertaken. Projects using similar approaches should provide a good basis for establishing comparative equity between cities.},

Areas where mainly young Caucasians, highly educated people live, and that have high access to community resources, presented greater access to BSS. Based on the concept of spatial fairness and its subjectivity, we developed a framework for a qualitative and quantitative assessment to help decision-makers and the general public evaluate the allocation of BSS infrastructure. First, from the general concept of justice, we developed our definition of spatial fairness assessment based on the rules of spatial equity, equality, and efficiency. Then, we developed a qualitative and quantitative spatial fairness assessment of BSS. The qualitative assessment aims to understand how underprivileged people perceive the spatial fairness of BSSs taking as case study non-motorized households in Strasbourg feeling socially excluded. The quantitative assessment helps to numerically determine which distribution rule (equity, equality, efficiency) the infrastructure of a BSS follows. This assessment was applied in residential blocks inside the service area of the hybrid BSS in Munich, Germany. We developed a concept of availability as an accessibility indicator. As social indicators, we considered social milieus, access to other opportunities (e.g. health, education), and developed a deprivation index that is a combination of those two. As a result of the qualitative assessment, non-motorized individuals who felt socially excluded were less likely to talk about BSS at all. Furthermore, bicycles' availability in the bike-sharing system in Munich matched the efficiency and equity rule, although lower availability of bikes correlates to residential blocks where traditional-oriented social groups live. Policy makers, stakeholders, urban and transport planners, and the general public have now available 1) the perception of a group of the underprivileged population about BSS, and 2) a quantitative methodology to identify which distribution rule(s) the infrastructure of a BSS follows and which social groups are spatially advantaged or disadvantaged by it. Further research may be oriented to apply the approach in the same city or applying them to more case studies.},

However, due to the relatively recent adoption of BSS, there is very little research exploring how people consider these systems within existing transportation options. Given recent BSS growth around the world, there is substantial interest in identifying contributing factors that encourage individuals to use these systems. The current study contributes to this growing literature by examining BSS behavior at the trip level to analyze bicyclists' destination preferences. Specifically, we study the decision process involved in identifying destination locations after picking up a bicycle at a BSS station, using a random utility maximization approach in the form of a multinomial logit model (MNL). The quantitative frameworks developed have been estimated using 2013 data from the Chicago's Divvy system. In our modeling effort, we distinguish between BSS users with annual membership and short-term customers with daily passes. The developed model should allow bicycle-sharing system operators to plan services more effectively by examining the impact of travel distance, land use, built environment, and access to public transportation infrastructure on users' destination preferences. Using the estimated model, we generated utility profiles as a function of distance and various other attributes, allowing us to represent visually the trade-offs that individuals make in the decision process. To illustrate further the applicability of the proposed framework for planning purposes, destination station-choice probability prediction is undertaken.},

An online survey was administered to a sample of annual members of Australia's two bikeshare programs based in Brisbane and Melbourne, to assess motivations for joining the schemes. Non-members of the programs were also sampled in order to identify current barriers to joining bikeshare. Spatial analysis from Brisbane revealed residential and work locations of non-members were more geographically dispersed than for bikeshare members. An analysis of bikeshare usage in Melbourne showed a strong relationship between docking stations in areas with relatively less accessible public transit opportunities. The most influential barriers to bikeshare use related to motorized travel being too convenient and docking stations not being sufficiently close to home, work and other frequented destinations. The findings suggest that bikeshare programs may attract increased membership by ensuring travel times are competitive with motorized travel, for example through efficient bicycle routing and priority progression and, by expanding docking station locations, and by increasing the level of convenience associated with scheme use. Convenience considerations may include strategic location of docking stations, ease of signing up and integration with public transport.},

A thematic analytic method was used to analyse the data. Three main themes were found: Accessibility/spontaneity, safety and weather/topography. The lengthy sign-up process was thought to stifle the spontaneity typically thought to attract people to public bike share. Mandatory helmet legislation was thought to reduce spontaneous use. Safety was a major concern for all groups and this included a perceived lack of suitable bicycle infrastructure, as well as regular riders describing a negative attitude of some car drivers. Interestingly, CityCycle riders unanimously perceived car driver attitudes to improve when on CityCycle bicycles relative to riding on personal bicycles. Conclusions: In order to increase the popularity of the CityCycle scheme, the results of this study suggest that a more accessible, spontaneous sign-up process is required, 24/7 opening hours, and greater incentives to sign up new members and casual users, as seeing people using CityCycle appears critical to further take up.},

  abstract = {Over 800 cities globally now offer bikeshare programs. One of their purported benefits is increased physical activity. Implicit in this claim is that bikeshare replaces sedentary modes of transport, particularly car use. This paper estimates the median changes in physical activity levels as a result of bikeshare in the cities of Melbourne, Brisbane, Washington, D.C., London, and Minneapolis/St. Paul. This study is the first known multi-city evaluation of the active travel impacts of bikeshare programs. To perform the analysis, data on mode substitution (i.e. the modes that bikeshare replaces) were used to determine the extent of shift from sedentary to active transport modes (e.g. when a car trip is replaced by bikeshare). Potentially offsetting these gains, reductions in physical activity when walking trips are replaced by bikeshare was also estimated. Finally a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis was conducted to estimate confidence bounds on estimated impacts on active travel given uncertainties in data sources. The results indicate that on average 60\% of bikeshare trips replace sedentary modes of transport (from 42\% in Minneapolis/St. Paul to 67\% in Brisbane). When bikeshare replaces a walking trip, there is a reduction in active travel time because walking a given distance takes longer than cycling. Considering the active travel balance sheet for the cities included in this analysis, bikeshare activity in 2012 has an overall positive impact on active travel time. This impact ranges from an additional 1.4 million minutes of active travel for the Minneapolis/St. Paul bikeshare program, to just over 74 million minutes of active travel for the London program The analytical approach adopted to estimate bikeshare's impact on active travel may act as the basis for future bikeshare evaluations or feasibility studies.},

Several themes have begun to emerge from studies examining bikeshare. Convenience is the major motivator for bikeshare use. Financial savings has been found to motivate those on a low income and the distance one lives from a docking station is an important predictor for bikeshare membership. In a range of countries, it has been found that just under 50\% of bikeshare members use the system less than once a month. Men use bikeshare more than women, but the imbalance is not as dramatic as private bike riding (at least in low cycling countries). Commuting is the most common trip purpose for annual members. Users are less likely than private cyclists to wear helmets, but in countries with mandatory helmet legislation, usage levels have suffered. Bikeshare users appear less likely to be injured than private bike riders. Future directions include integration with e-bikes, GPS (global positioning system), dockless systems and improved public transport integration. Greater research is required to quantify the impacts of bikeshare, in terms of mode choice, emissions, congestion and health.},

Several consistent themes have emerged within the growing body of research on bike share programs. Firstly, the importance bike share members place on convenience and value for money appears paramount in their motivation to sign up and use these programs. Secondly, and somewhat counter intuitively, scheme members are more likely to own and use private bicycles than nonmembers. Thirdly, users demonstrate a greater reluctance to wear helmets than private bicycle riders and helmets have acted as a deterrent in jurisdictions in which helmets are mandatory.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We examined associations between residential exposure to BIXI (BIcycle-taXI)-a public bicycle share program implemented in Montreal, Quebec, in 2009, which increases accessibility to cycling by making available 5050 bicycles at 405 bicycle docking stations-and likelihood of cycling (BIXI and non-BIXI) in Montreal over the first 2 years of implementation. METHODS: Three population-based samples of adults participated in telephone surveys. Data collection occurred at the launch of the program (spring 2009), and at the end of the first (fall 2009) and second (fall 2010) seasons of implementation. Difference in differences models assessed whether greater cycling was observed for those exposed to BIXI compared with those not exposed at each time point. RESULTS: We observed a greater likelihood of cycling for those exposed to the public bicycle share program after the second season of implementation (odds ratio = 2.86; 95\% confidence interval = 1.85, 4.42) after we controlled for weather, built environment, and individual variables. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of a public bicycle share program can lead to greater likelihood of cycling among persons living in areas where bicycles are made available.},

  abstract = {Background Cycling contributes to physical activity and health. Public bicycle share programs (PBSPs) increase population access to bicycles by deploying bicycles at docking stations throughout a city. Minimal research has systematically examined the prevalence and correlates of PBSP use. Purpose To determine the prevalence and correlates of use of a new public bicycle share program called BIXI (name merges the word BIcycle and taXI) implemented in May 2009 in Montreal, Canada. Methods A total of 2502 adults were recruited to a telephone survey in autumn 2009 via random-digit dialing according to a stratified random sampling design. The prevalence of BIXI bicycle use was estimated. Multivariate logistic regression allowed for identification of correlates of use. Data analysis was conducted in spring and summer 2010. Results The unweighted mean age of respondents was 47.4 (SD=16.8) years and 61.4\% were female. The weighted prevalence for use of BIXI bicycles at least once was 8.2\%. Significant correlates of BIXI bicycle use were having a BIXI docking station within 250 m of home, being aged 18\textendash 24 years, being university educated, being on work leave, and using cycling as the primary mode of transportation to work. Conclusions A newly implemented public bicycle share program attracts a substantial fraction of the population and is more likely to attract younger and more educated people who currently use cycling as a primary transportation mode.},

One of the key factors for the success of such programs is the location of bike stations in relation to potential demand (population, activities and public transport stations). This study proposes a GIS-based method to calculate the spatial distribution of the potential demand for trips, locate stations using location\textendash allocation models, determine station capacity and define the characteristics of the demand for stations. The results obtained are compared with the most commonly used location\textendash allocation modeling approaches: minimizing impedance and maximizing coverage. For the objective of this study, the latter approach is more useful. Diminishing returns are observed in both cases: as the number of stations increases, there is less improvement in the fraction of the population covered and accessibility to stations. Because the spatial structure of the proposed network also plays an important role in bike-station use, an additional accessibility analysis was carried out to calculate the volume of activity to which a station has access. With this analysis, stations that are relatively isolated, and therefore of little use to potential users, can be eliminated.},

Accessibility measures are reviewed using a broad range of relevant criteria, including theoretical basis, interpretability and communicability, and data requirements of the measures. Accessibility impacts of land-use and transport strategies are often evaluated using accessibility measures, which researchers and policy makers can easily operationalise and interpret, such as travelling speed, but which generally do not satisfy theoretical criteria. More complex and disaggregated accessibility measures, however, increase complexity and the effort for calculations and the difficulty of interpretation. The current practice can be much improved by operationalising more advanced location-based and utility-based accessibility measures that are still relatively easy to interpret for researchers and policy makers, and can be computed with state-of-the-practice data and/or land-use and transport models. Research directions towards theoretically more advanced accessibility measures point towards the inclusion of individual's spatial\textendash temporal constraints and feedback mechanisms between accessibility, land-use and travel behaviour. Furthermore, there is a need for theoretical and empirical research on relationships between accessibility, option values and non-user benefits, and the measurement of different components of accessibility.},

As of 2015, there were 74 U.S. cities operating bikeshare programs. More than half of these programs are seasonal, meaning they shut down their operations for winter. This study focuses on gathering more knowledge and information relating to winter bikesharing for the United States in terms of understanding users' willingness to use bikeshare programs in harsh winters, and operators' strategies, challenges and best practices for providing bikeshare operations without interruption in cold U.S. cities. Great Rides Bikeshare users in Fargo, North Dakota, were surveyed in October 2015 to understand their willingness to use the bikeshare program in winter and determine factors influencing their ridership. Based on 654 returned survey responses, significant number (70\%\textendash 95\%) of regular, occasional, and infrequent bikeshare users expressed their willingness to use bikeshare program in winter; further, the willingness increased among users in situations when bike paths and sidewalks could be cleared of snow and ice. A second survey was conducted in February 2016 with bikeshare program operators located in other cold U.S. cities that expect snow events, freezing temperatures, and other adverse winter weather conditions and were operational for the 2015\textendash 2016 winter. Expected ridership for bikeshare program during the winter has been observed anywhere between 10 and 30\% of peak summer ridership. Winter bikeshare operational strategies, challenges, and best practices were gathered from 10 out of 14 bikeshare programs that were operated through 2015\textendash 2016 winter. Results from this study can be useful to researchers, and bikeshare operators who want to implement year-round bikeshare operations in cold cities with winter conditions.},

This may in turn help normalise the image of cycling, and reduce perceptions that cycling is `risky' or `only for sporty people'. This paper sought to compare the use of specialist cycling clothing between users of the London bicycle sharing system (LBSS) and cyclists using personal bicycles. To do this, we observed 3594 people on bicycles at 35 randomly-selected locations across central and inner London. The 592 LBSS users were much less likely to wear helmets (16\% vs. 64\% among personal-bicycle cyclists), high-visibility clothes (11\% vs. 35\%) and sports clothes (2\% vs. 25\%). In total, 79\% of LBSS users wore none of these types of specialist cycling clothing, as compared to only 30\% of personal-bicycle cyclists. This was true of male and female LBSS cyclists alike (all p{$>$}0.25 for interaction). We conclude that bicycle sharing systems may not only encourage cycling directly, by providing bicycles to rent, but also indirectly, by increasing the number and diversity of cycling `role models' visible.},

This study examined the impact of a public bicycle share program on bicycling amongst residents of Vancouver, BC.

We used difference in differences estimation to assess whether there was an increase in bicycling amongst those living and/or working in close proximity ({$\leq$}500 m) to Vancouver's Mobi by Shaw Go public bicycle share program, compared to those living and working outside this area. Results suggest that only living or only working inside the bicycle share service area was not associated with increases in bicycling at T1 or T2 relative to those outside the service area. Both living and working inside the bicycle share service area was associated with increases in bicycling at T1 (OR: 2.26, 95\% CI: 1.07, 4.80), however not at T2 (OR: 1.37, 95\% CI: 0.67, 2.83).

The location of bicycle share docking stations has been cited as a major barrier to uptake among lower socioeconomic groups. This study aimed to assess spatial access to bicycle share programs in Canadian cities by comparing the socioeconomic characteristics of dissemination areas inside and outside the bicycle share service areas. We obtained locations of bicycle share stations for the five existing programs in Canada: Vancouver, Hamilton, Toronto, Ottawa-Gatineau, and Montr\'eal. We used the material component of the Pampalon Deprivation Index (2011) as a measure of socioeconomic status for each dissemination area, calculating city-specific quintiles. We compared the distribution of deprivation for dissemination areas inside the bicycle share service area, compared with outside the service area. We found that advantaged areas have better access to bicycle share infrastructure in Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa-Gatineau, and Montr\'eal, and conversely, that disadvantaged areas have better access in Hamilton. This analysis indicates that in most cities, substantial effort is needed to expand service areas to disadvantaged areas in order to increase spatial access for lower socioeconomic populations.},

To date, most academic research around bikeshare systems in the United States has focused on the logistics of planning and operationalizing successful systems. Investigations of system users and effects on the local community are less common, and studies that are focused on efforts to engage underserved communities in bikeshare systems are rarer still. This paper relies on a survey of representatives from 56 U.S. bikeshare systems to better understand and document current approaches toward serving low-income and minority populations. The survey asked about equity policies and metrics, the degree to which equity considerations affect a variety of system practices, what the existing barriers to utilizing bikeshare are for target populations, and what challenges the bikeshare system entity faces in addressing those barriers. Results indicate that nearly one in four bikeshare systems has written policies around equity; nearly half of bikeshare systems with more than 500 bikes have such policies. However, many more systems consider equity in various aspects of their systems. Equity considerations affected station siting, fee structure and payment systems, and promotion and marketing in a majority of systems (68\%, 72\%, and 57\%, respectively), and operations and data collection and analysis, though to a lesser extent (42\% each). Bikeshare systems reported cost, access, and outreach as the largest barriers to equity, in addition to overall funding and staff levels.},

The analysis revealed that people of color, Hispanics, the less-educated, females, low income earners, and the unemployed are underrepresented in system membership. Regression analysis of non-user survey data suggested that nonwhite individuals are associated with a moderate increase in perceiving BBS to be challenging when riding with children or cargo. Being female is associated with concerns about system use, the ability to ride comfortably, maintaining personal hygiene, being a victim of crime or harassment, and an overall lack of interest in biking in Baltimore. Identifying as having low income or less education was not observed to be associated with any of the barrier conditions examined in this study. These findings can be leveraged to develop programs and policies to improve participation rates within underrepresented groups and enhance system equity.},

  abstract = {The cities of Paris, London, Chicago, and New York (among many others) have set up bike-share systems to facilitate the use of bicycles for urban commuting. This paper estimates the impact of two facets of system performance on bike-share ridership: accessibility (how far the user must walk to reach stations) and bike-availability (the likelihood of finding a bicycle). We obtain these estimates from a structural demand model for ridership estimated using data from the V\'elib' system in Paris. We find that every additional meter of walking to a station decreases a user's likelihood of using a bike from that station by 0.194\% ({$\pm$}0.0693\%), and an even more significant reduction at higher distances ({$>$}300 m). These estimates imply that almost 80\% of bike-share usage comes from areas within 300 m of stations, highlighting the need for dense station networks. We find that a 10\% increase in bike-availability would increase ridership by 12.211\% ({$\pm$}1.097\%), three-fourths of which comes from fewer abandonments and the rest of which comes from increased user interest. We illustrate the use of our estimates in comparing the effect of adding stations or increasing bike-availabilities in different parts of the city, at different times, and in evaluating other proposed improvements.This paper was accepted by Vishal Gaur, operations management.},

  abstract = {Abstract Cycling-inclusive urban planning is attracting attention worldwide because of the environmental, health, economic, and transport benefits inherent to cycling from the individual and the societal perspectives. The Czech Republic is one of the emerging cycling countries that are trying to promote and support cycling, but cycling mode shares are low because of the poor quality of the scarce infrastructure and the psychological barrier of the perceived lack of safety when cycling in mixed traffic. This study takes a multimodal approach based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour and focuses on the factors underlying the willingness to share the road from the perspective of cyclists and drivers: positive attitudes toward cycling, positive attitudes toward cyclists' behavior, social norms toward cycling and anxiety to share the road. A web-based questionnaire was tailor-designed and administered in the Czech Republic via social networks, web forums, and the Civinet network, and a hybrid bivariate-ordered model tested the behavioral framework. Results show that the willingness to share the road as a cyclist or as a driver relates positively to positive attitudes towards cycling and cyclists' behavior, and negatively to the anxiety of sharing the road. Moreover, mediator effects are observed and a clear relation emerges between the experience on the road as both a cyclist and a driver on the willingness to share the road as a cyclist. Lastly, results show that the factors underlying road sharing intentions are related significantly to gender, travel habits, and perceived personal and infrastructure-related barriers to cycling.},

  abstract = {Conventional integral measures of accessibility, although valuable as indicators of place accessibility, have several limitations when used to evaluate individual accessibility. Two alternatives for overcoming some of the difficulties involved are explored in this study. One is to adapt these measures for evaluating individual accessibility using a disaggregate, nonzonal approach. The other is to develop different types of measures based on an alternative conceptual framework. To pursue the former alternative, this study specifies and examines eighteen gravity-type and cumulative-opportunity accessibility measures using a point-based spatial framework. For the latter option, twelve space-time accessibility measures are developed based on the construct of a prism-constrained feasible opportunity set. This paper compares the relationships and spatial patterns of these thirty measures using network-based GIS procedures. Travel diary data collected in Columbus, Ohio, and a digital data set of 10,727 selected land parcels are used for all computation. Results of this study indicate that space-time and integral indices are distinctive types of accessibility measures which reflect different dimensions of the accessibility experience of individuals. Since space-time measures are more capable of capturing interpersonal differences, especially the effect of space-time constraints, they are more ``gender sensitive'' and helpful for unraveling gender/ethnic differences in accessibility. An important methodological implication is that whether accessibility is observed to be important or different between individuals depends heavily on whether the measure used is capable of revealing the kind of differences the analyst intends to observe.},

Abstract Interest in active transportation\textemdash especially walking and cycling\textemdash is growing within urban planning and transportation circles as a solution to the environmental and congestion issues plaguing many cities. This paper focuses on how far people are willing to walk or cycle for different trip purposes in Montr\'eal, Canada, and how travel distances vary spatially and by individuals' travel purpose and socio-economic characteristics. The research uses the 2003 Montr\'eal Origin-Destination Survey (O-D Survey) to calculate the network distance traveled by pedestrians and cyclists and to obtain travel and socio-economic characteristics for each individual. Whereas walking distance literature often focuses on distance to transit, this paper examines walking and cycling trips where a second transit mode is not the intended destination. Primarily, the paper reveals that median walking distances recorded in the O-D survey (650 metres) are greater than the commonly-accepted distance or catchment area of 400 metres; various personal built environment factors influence these distances. While no widely-held standard exists for cycling, the analysis reveals a median distance of around two kilometres with a high degree of variation in distances. The findings will guide planners, designers, developers, and policy makers and suggest future research directions within the field.},

In this paper, we study one such example: the effect of changing the user-access policy in the London Barclays Cycle Hire scheme. When the scheme was launched in July 2010, users were required to apply for a key to access to the system. By December 2010, this policy was overridden in order to allow for ``casual'' usage, so that anyone in possession of a debit or credit card could gain access. While the transport authority measured the policy shift's success by the increased number of trips, we set out to investigate how the change affected the system's usage throughout the city. We present an extensive analysis of station data collected from the scheme's web site both pre- and post-policy change, showing how differences in both global and local behaviour can be measured, and how the policy change correlates with a variety of effects observed around the city. We find that, as expected, quicker access to the system correlates with greater week end usage; it also reinforces the week-day commuting trend. In both the pre- and post-change periods, the geographic distribution of activity at individual stations forms concentric circles around central London. However, upon policy change, a number of stations undergo a complete usage change, now exhibiting an opposite trend with respect to that which they had prior to the policy change.},

The former is a special case of the latter. Based on the 2000 Census and primary care physician data, this research assesses the variation of spatial accessibility to primary care in the Chicago region, and analyzes the sensitivity of results by experimenting with ranges of threshold travel times in the FCA method and travel friction coefficients in the gravity model.

A dataset containing 161,426 GPS trajectories describing observed routes of cyclists using SoBi bikes over a 12-month period (April 1, 2015 to March 31, 2016) is used for analysis. This study groups trips by origin-destination hub pairs and uses a GIS (geographic information system)-based map-matching algorithm to generate routes along with attributes such as length, number of intersections, number of turns, and unique road segments. Unique routes and their use frequencies are extracted from all the hub-to-hub trips using a GIS-based link signature extraction tool developed for this research. The most popular routes between hubs taken by cyclists are then identified as dominant routes and their attributes are compared to those of corresponding shortest path routes derived by minimizing distance traveled. The comparison finds significant differences in multiple attributes, and demonstrates that dominant routes are significantly longer than their shortest distance counterparts, suggesting that cyclists are willing to detour for routes characterized by positive features such as bicycle facilities and low traffic volumes. Detouring does, however, come at a cost \textendash{} increases in number of turns and number of intersections.

  abstract = {Bicycle Sharing Systems (BSS) are now ubiquitous due to their plausible environmental and social benefits promoted by municipalities, operators and technology providers. Recent practices and literature however undermines many suggested benefits of BSS showing they mostly facilitate transport for already privileged demographics in increasingly exclusive urban cores. Additionally, case study performance estimates in Europe and North America commonly show low usage rates further undermining promoted benefits. In the context of urban transports existing social injustice, energy consumption and land use, which cannot be sustained, this work, drawing on data analysis, interviews and literature and media review in North America and Europe, presents how existing BSS deployments have intrinsic flaws. These convenient luxuries are typically not effective or less so than familiar, proven and less technologically innovative opportunities at achieving greater cycling modal share. This paper illustrates how with BSS deployments converge many actors, promoting success and beneficial narratives, gain advantage through diverse outcomes while residents subsidize the services economically, through public land or advertising, while receiving few benefits. Municipalities and decision makers regularly use BSS to promote themselves, their city, attract investment and develop local pride in representatives and their policy. Beyond being a good example of policy boosterism and rich in rhetoric, BSS often have less effective or just outcomes than alternative transport policies. Advertisers meanwhile utilize sustainability narratives to capitalize on new markets and commodification opportunities while effectively undermining promoted BSS outcomes. This paper provides a critical history of BSS, summarizes their stated purposes and benefits and utilizes a smart-city critique framework to evaluate outcomes. This work concludes that most BSS typically benefit the privileged, help little to increase mass cycling transport and are used as easily deployable technological (false) solutions to contemporary problems while advancing unjust tendencies to privatize public space and services.},

It analyzes the frequency and length of walking episodes, categorized by origins, purposes, and destinations, and also investigates distance-decay functions for major destinations. The study employs day-after recall time diary and questionnaire data from the 2007\textendash 8 Space\textendash Time Activity Research (STAR) survey conducted in Halifax, Canada. GPS co-ordinate data enhanced the accuracy of location information, start times, and end times of the 1790 AT walking episodes, while GIS software was used to compute a shortest-path distance between the origin and destination of each episode. Home is both the most common origin and destination for AT walks, and the most common purpose is travel-to-shop rather than travel-to-work. Most walks are to non-home locations, such as retail establishments and offices. Particularly important are restaurants and bars, grocery stores, shopping centers, banks, and other services. All major destinations show strong distance-decay effects: most walks are shorter than 600m, and very few exceed 1200m. The assumption employed in the walkability literature, that one should restrict the `neighborhood of opportunity' to walking destinations within 1000m of the home, is seen to be well justified. However, a planning policy focus on the walker's home neighborhood is revealed as questionable, since the majority of walking trips do not originate from the home. The relationship between urban land-use patterns and walkability may therefore require some rethinking.},

  abstract = {Background Bike sharing systems have potential to substantially boost active transportation levels (and consequent physical and mental health) in urban populations. We explored equity of spatial access in a novel `dockless' bike share system that does not that constrain bike pickup and drop-off locations to docking stations. Methods Starting in July 2017, Seattle, Washington piloted a dockless bike share system that made 10,000 bikes available. We merged data on resident sociodemographic and economic characteristics from the American Community Survey about 93 defined neighborhoods with data about bike locations, bike idle time, and which neighborhoods operators rebalanced bikes to. We used mapping and descriptive statistics to compare access between neighborhoods along sociodemographic and economic lines. Results With many bikes available, no neighborhood was consistently excluded from access. However, the average availability ranged from 3 bikes per day to 341 per day. Neighborhoods with more bikes had more college-educated residents (median 75\% college-educated vs. 65\%) and local community resources (median opportunity index score of 24 vs. 19), and higher incomes (median 83,202 vs. 71,296). Rebalancing destinations were strongly correlated with neighborhood demand (r = 0.61). Conclusions The overall scale of the dockless system ensured there was baseline access throughout Seattle. We observed modest inequities in access along sociodemographic lines, similar to prior findings in studies of docked bike share systems. Dockless bike share systems hold promise for offering equitable spatial access to bike sharing.},

The methodology of this study was based on statistical analysis including ANOVA, and binary and multinomial logistic regression models. The results of the study include several findings. First, the travel pattern of riders differs according to the status of their memberships, the day of week, and the land use of where they started and ended their trip. Second, there is a large gender difference among BBS membership users, and males are the dominate users. Finally, females tended to have more recreational trips and start and end their trips from/to the same station when compared to male riders.},

We sought to examine inequalities in uptake and usage of London's Barclays Cycle Hire (BCH) scheme. Method We obtained complete BCH registration data, and compared users with the general population. We examined usage levels by explanatory variables including gender, small-area income-deprivation and local cycling prevalence. Results 100,801 registered individuals made 2.5 million trips between July 2010 and March 2011. Compared with residents and workers in the central London area served by the scheme, registered individuals were more likely to be male and to live in areas of low deprivation and high cycling prevalence. Among those registered, females made 1.63 (95\%CI 1.53, 1.74) fewer trips per month than males, and made under a fifth of all trips. Adjusting for the fact that deprived areas were less likely to be close to BCH docking stations, users in the most deprived areas made 0.85 (95\%CI 0.63,1.07) more trips per month than those in the least deprived areas. Conclusion Females and residents in deprived areas are underrepresented among users of London's public bicycle sharing scheme. The scheme's planned expansion into more deprived areas has, however, the potential to create a more equitable uptake of cycling.},

  abstract = {Accessibility is a widely used concept in transportation planning and research. However a majority of the literature is concerned with accessibility in infrastructure-rich regions where it is used to assess the output of infrastructure. Relatively scant attention in contrast has been paid to the topic of accessibility in infrastructure-poor regions. These are regions characterized by non-homogeneous landscapes with limited or no transportation infrastructure. Even studies that deal with infrastructure-poor regions tend to transpose the methods used elsewhere. This practice seems inappropriate when mobility happens by active rather than motorized modes since the effort required for movement is likely different. The objective of this paper is to compare distance, time, and metabolic energy cost functions in walking accessibility. To this end, we present a case study of accessibility to water in central Kenya. The results indicate that Euclidean distance, surface distance, and travel time correlate better between them than any of them does with metabolic energy. Furthermore, while shortest paths tend to be symmetric for distance and time criteria, under consideration of metabolic energy expenditure pathways change significantly depending on the direction of movement. This has implications for measuring accessibility and equity. By providing alternate mechanisms for valuing the cost of movement, this research suggests avenues to consider vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women who require greater nutritional intake and expend more energy per unit activity. Directions for further research include certain trade-offs between route choice variables across various applications, for example, walking and cycling route choice algorithms.},

  abstract = {Floating Catchment Area (FCA) methods are a popular tool to investigate accessibility to public facilities, in particular health care services. FCA approaches are attractive because, unlike other accessibility measures, they take into account the potential for congestion of facilities. This is done by 1) considering the population within the catchment area of a facility to calculate a variable that measures level of service, and then 2) aggregating the level of service by population centers subject to catchment area constraints. In this paper we discuss an effect of FCA approaches, an artifact that we term demand and level of service inflation. These artifacts are present in previous implementations of FCA methods. We argue that inflation makes interpretation of estimates of accessibility difficult, which has possible deleterious consequences for decision making. Next, we propose a simple and intuitive approach to proportionally allocate demandand and level of service in FCA calculations. The approach is based on a standardization of the impedance matrix, similar to approaches popular in the spatial statistics and econometrics literature. The result is a more intiuitive measure of accessibility that 1) provides a local version of the provider-to-population ratio; and 2) preserves the level of demand and the level of supply in a system. We illustrate the relevant issues with some examples, and then empirically by means of a case study of accessibility to family physicians in the Hamilton Census Metropolitan Area (CMA), in Ontario, Canada. Results indicate that demand and supply inflation/deflation affect the interpretation of accessibility analysis using existing FCA methods, and that the proposed adjustment can lead to more intuitive results.},

Recent studies try to model how the number of COVID-19 infections will likely grow and impact the demand for hospitalization services at national and regional levels. However, less attention has been paid to the geographic access to COVID-19 healthcare services and to hospitals' response capacity at the local level, particularly in urban areas in the Global South. This paper shows how transport accessibility analysis can provide actionable information to help improve healthcare coverage and responsiveness. It analyzes accessibility to COVID-19 healthcare at high spatial resolution in the 20 largest cities of Brazil. Using network-distance metrics, we estimate the vulnerable population living in areas with poor access to healthcare facilities that could either screen or hospitalize COVID-19 patients. We then use a new balanced floating catchment area (BFCA) indicator to estimate spatial, income, and racial inequalities in access to hospitals with intensive care unit (ICU) beds and mechanical ventilators while taking into account congestion effects. Based on this analysis, we identify substantial social and spatial inequalities in access to health services during the pandemic. The availability of ICU equipment varies considerably between cities, and it is substantially lower among black and poor communities. The study maps territorial inequalities in healthcare access and reflects on different policy lessons that can be learned for other countries based on the Brazilian case.},

Cluster analysis is then used to analyze the geographic distribution of the associated improvements. The results show that bike-and-ride has the potential to substantially increase job accessibility in the different areas of the city, but does not result in a more equal spatial distribution of job accessibility, as measured by Gini coefficients. Most of the improvements are centered in middle to high income areas with good accessibility. Peripheral areas, that tend to be the poorest and have the lowest accessibility by transit, improve the least. The inclusion of the bicycle is not enough to counteract all of the other forces causing low job accessibility in these areas.},

However, low-income populations, people of color, and transit-dependent households are not highly representative of the bikeshare user's profile. Some bikeshare programs in the United States, such as Divvy in Chicago, try to address this equity problem by promoting their systems among low-income communities. Currently, there is limited research estimating bikeshare ridership in these communities and quantitatively analyzing the impacts of financial barriers in disadvantaged areas at the station level. This research fills this gap by analyzing the current utilization of bikeshare systems among disadvantaged populations. The study develops a Negative Binomial regression model to estimate bikeshare ridership using data from Chicago's bikeshare system. The results show that bikeshare stations in disadvantaged communities generate around two-thirds of the average annual trips across all stations. The employment rate plays an important role in increasing bikeshare ridership, especially for disadvantaged areas. Additionally, the research found that the proportion of trips by annual members is significantly lower in disadvantaged communities than in other areas. However, interestingly, residents in disadvantaged communities tend to make longer bikeshare trips once they are annual members. Their dependence on bikeshare systems may result from accessibility improvement (e.g., work commute by bikeshare). Based on all the findings, we discuss planning implications for more socially inclusive and equitable bikeshare systems.},

  abstract = {Dockless bikeshare systems show potential for replacing traditional dock-based systems, primarily by offering greater flexibility for bike returns. However, many cities in the US currently regulate the maximum number of bikes a dockless system can deploy due to bicycle management issues. Despite inventory management challenges, dockless systems offer two main advantages over dock-based systems: a lower (sometimes zero) membership fee, and being free-range (or, at least free-range within designated service areas). Moreover, these two advantages may help to solve existing access barriers for disadvantaged populations. To date, much of the research on micro-mobility options has focused on addressing equity issues in dock-based systems. We have limited knowledge of the extent to which dockless systems can help mitigate barriers to bikeshare for disadvantaged populations. Using San Francisco as a case study, because the city has both dock-based and dockless systems running concurrently, we quantify bikeshare service levels for communities of concern (CoCs) by analyzing the spatial distribution of service areas, available bikes and bike idle times, trip data, and rebalancing among dock-based and dockless systems. We find that dockless systems can provide greater availability of bikes for CoCs than for other communities, attracting more trip demand in these communities because of a larger service area and frequent bike rebalancing practices. More importantly, we notice that the existence of electric bikes helps mitigate the bikeshare usage gap between CoCs and other tracts. Our results provide policy insights to local municipalities on how to properly regulate dockless bikeshare systems to improve equity.},

Bikeshare systems have not captured high levels of ridership from disadvantaged populations, but there is some evidence that current bikeshare systems have specifically targeted certain populations to ensure sufficiently high demand for profitability. Far less attention has been paid to bikeshare programs' potential to provide greater access to jobs and essential services for disadvantaged communities. This paper uses two case study cities (Chicago and Philadelphia) to first, examine whether bikeshare systems have targeted specific populations, and to second, quantitatively assess the potential for bikeshare systems to provide greater accessibility for disadvantaged communities. Our results demonstrate that a well-designed bikeshare system can generate greater accessibility improvements for disadvantaged communities than the same system would produce for other populations. Using a newly developed spatial index that combines the potential for increased access to jobs and essential services, the level of bike infrastructure, and the disadvantaged population shares, we also find evidence that existing bikeshare systems have been specifically designed to target certain ridership. We find that locating stations in proximity to disadvantaged communities has the potential to increase household access (by bike and by bike-to-transit) to jobs and essential services and can close accessibility gaps between mobility constrained populations and critical services. The spatial index can be applied to identify potential locations to locate bikeshare stations (dock-based bikeshare systems) or rebalance bikes (dockless bikeshare systems) to address bikeshare equity issues.},

  abstract = {By understanding gender disparities in bike share usage in New York City, programs can be better tailored to increase cycling and bike share usage among female members. Data from bike trips and a Citi Bike enrollment survey for the period 2013\textendash 2018 were used for this analysis. Associations comparing female to male members on selected study variables were examined through the estimation of odds ratios (OR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) using bivariate logistic regression models and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for continuous non-normal data. Spatial autocorrelation of bike share station pick ups and drop offs by percentage of female bike share members was detected using local Moran's I. This study included 226,237 Citi Bike members; of these, over one-third (38.1\%) self-identified as female. The optional enrollment survey was completed by 33,945 members; of these, 37.9\% self-identified as female. Compared to male gender, female gender was associated with younger age, higher levels of education completed, being a student and not employed, and lower household income, as well as social and health reasons for membership rather than utilitarian reasons. Overall, female members took fewer bike share trips (median: 46.0 per year vs. 78.5 for males). There was spatial correlation between station usage and gender, with female members more likely than male members to use Citi Bikes in less dense neighborhoods. The results from this study highlight the gender disparity in bike share membership and usage in NYC and provide insight into how this gap could be reduced.},

  abstract = {Introduction New York City's bike share system (Citi Bike) is the largest of its kind in the U.S. and has the potential to provide population-level health benefits. Bike share members who were not regular cyclists before membership may experience health benefits given an opportunity for physical activity that had not previously been available. Little is known about the characteristics of those who become frequent bike share users among those who had not previously cycled. Methods Data from a Citi Bike member survey, as well as data from trips were used for this analysis. Frequent bike share users were defined as members in the upper quartile of total trips among survey respondents who lived in a neighborhood with a Citi Bike station and had taken at least one trip in their first year of membership. Analyses were restricted to those who reported not having ridden a bicycle in NYC in the 12 months before their membership. Logistic regression was used to calculate crude and adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI) to determine the characteristics of frequent bike share users. Results Factors independently associated with becoming a frequent bike share user within the first year of Citi Bike membership included male sex; lower household income; lack of car ownership; being physically active; and reported their primary reason for membership of a faster way to get around town, or to save money on transportation. Conclusions The results of this study highlight that motivations not related to health, such as wanting a less expensive and more efficient form of transportation, might contribute to the use of active transportation like cycling. Frequent use among those with lower household incomes provides additional rationale for expansion of bike share to low-income neighborhoods.},

  abstract = {Parks are elemental components of urban landscapes that provide environmental and social function value. In particular, urban parks provide spaces for open-air physical activity. In order to enjoy the opportunities for activities in parks, users must have reasonable access to these resources. A starting point for inquiries about utilization and potential benefits of urban green spaces is an assessment of their geographical accessibility. Of particular interest, in terms of potential users of parks, are children, whose geographical range is limited by their ability to traverse space using nonmotorized modes of transportation, or by their dependence on adults for common forms of motorized mobility. The objective of this paper is to measure accessibility to urban parks from the perspective of children traveling by walking in Montreal, Canada. Implementation of accessibility measures is supported by statistical analysis of trip length using Montreal's 2008 Household Travel Surveys database. Estimates of trip length based on attributes such as age, gender, income class, family structure, as well as geographical location are used to calculate accessibility to urban parks. We evaluate the relationship between the distribution of children population and conditions of accessibility to urban parks to understand the potential for use and possible spatial disparities in the distribution of urban parks. This research contributes to the assessment of the distribution of access to urban parks by children, and can assist planners and policy makers to improve the supply of parks, while accounting for the mobility patterns of children.},

Open spaces improve the quality of the environment, quality of life, and promote social interaction and inclusion. There is evidence of positive impacts on health. This research analyses the potential accessibility to open spaces in two Chilean cities, Valdivia and Temuco. Analysis of accessibility is based on patterns of daily mobility by travelers while considering their trips and transport modes, in particular walking. Statistical analysis of trip length forms the basis of an adaptive threshold for the calculation of a cumulative potential measure of accessibility. The analysis shows that, for these two cities, variations in accessibility tend to be driven by age and gender, and less by income. There are also variations between the two cities, with Temuco showing better levels of accessibility, as a consequence of residents generally undertaking longer walking trips.},

Research has shown that low-income communities and communities of color are often exposed to greater harms and enjoy fewer benefits from transportation systems than the general population. However, federally-mandated EJ analyses rarely conclude that projects could result in disproportionate impacts to these communities. This paper investigates the methods used to define EJ communities\textemdash a key analytical step for which there is little specific guidance\textemdash as a potential driver of variation in observed EJ outcomes. Using a case study of transit accessibility in Fresno County, California, the paper contrasts three methods for the identification of EJ communities: (1) a commonly used threshold-based approach that groups geographic areas using demographics, (2) a population-weighted approach that calculates weighted means of performance measures, and (3) community-based identification of EJ areas. The analysis indicates that the first method is appropriate for targeting transportation investments but not for assessing EJ outcomes, while the second two methods are appropriate for assessing EJ outcomes. Importantly, the method used to define EJ communities can substantially affect the analytical outcome, potentially shifting a finding of inequity from null to positive or vice versa. These results have important implications for transportation planning agencies and transportation service providers that conduct EJ and equity analyses, as a finding of inequity may lead to design changes or mitigations.},

A GIS-based map-matching algorithm is used to derive users' routes along the cycling network within Hamilton, Ontario and generate multiple attributes for each route, such as route distance, route directness, average distance between intersections, and the number of turns, intersections, and unique road segments. Concerning route choice analysis, the origin and destination pair should be the same for all routes within a choice set, thus HBS users' trips are grouped by origin-destination hub pairs. Since trips taken by different users between a hub pair can follow the same route, unique routes are extracted using a link signature extraction tool. Following this, a normalized Gini (Gn) coefficient is calculated for each hub pair to evaluate users' preferences among all the unique hub-to-hub route choices. A Gn closer to 0 indicates that routes between a hub pair are more evenly used, while a value closer to 1 implies a higher preference toward one dominant route. Three route choice models, a global model, a medium Gn model, and a high Gn model, are estimated using Path-Size Logit to determine how route choice is affected by the presence of dominant routes. These models suggest that HBS users are willing to detour for some attributes, such as bicycle facilities, but tend to avoid circuitous routes, turns, steep slopes, and roads with high traffic volume.},

This study analyzes the effects of weather conditions, temporal variables, hub attributes (most of which are derived for 200 m buffers around hubs), and a one-day lag on daily ridership at the bike share's hubs during its first year of operation. Two random intercept multilevel models are estimated \textendash{} one for daily trip departures, the other for daily trip arrivals. All weather (temperature, precipitation) and temporal variables (daylight hours, university terms, weekdays, holidays) are statistically significant in both models. Conversely, variables measuring transportation infrastructure in the vicinity of hubs, including the amount of bike lanes, are largely insignificant, suggesting that these features of the built environment have little to no influence on ridership. Proximity to important locations in the city (McMaster University, Hamilton's downtown) has a strong impact on ridership. Although population density was an important consideration when locating the hubs, population does not influence daily departures or arrivals. Employment in the vicinity of hubs, which serves as a surrogate for an area's activities or its attractiveness, does influence ridership, as is the case for the one-day lag effect. While all of these variables are able to explain some of the differences in daily ridership activity between hubs, the random intercept models confirm that they do not explain all of it. In other words, there remain intrinsic differences between hubs that are not captured by the independent variables \textendash{} differences that influence ridership.},

  abstract = {As a sustainable mode of transportation, public bicycles significantly improve daily mobility. The location of stations is a key element for the success of a public bicycle system, as a long walking distance will reduce people's willingness to use this mode of transportation. Building forms in China are different from the open type seen abroad. Many residential, office and school areas are enclosed by walls, and pedestrian flow is concentrated at the entrances/exits of these areas. Therefore, the station must be located close to the building entrance/exit. Previous studies on station location located the stations only per zone, without providing the exact locations of the stations in the zones. This paper considers the optimal distance between the building entrance/exit and the station to determine the exact station locations. The results can serve as a reference for the planning and optimization of public bicycle stations. A questionnaire survey was conducted in Beijing to determine users' walking distances to the stations. The results indicated that the walking distance decay laws of stations were different for different land uses. Moreover, a binary logistic model was developed to verify that users with different travel purposes have different walking distances. Based on the above results, we explored the optimal distances and tolerable distances between the building entrance/exit and the station for different land uses. These distances can be used to determine exact station locations to meet users' physiological and psychological needs.},

In this regard, young people are indicated to have better satisfaction as compared to the older generation. Convenience and financial savings are two key factors that affect user's choice of bikeshare, while safety concerns in relation to the intervention of other vehicles on the road as well as the lack of dedicated bicycle infrastructure are major barriers for the use of bikeshare.

But who stands to benefit from these investments, and in what context?

The existing measurements of BAcc rarely consider the factor of ownership of bikes, which means that no distinction is made between private-bikes and shared bikes. To measure BAcc more fully, this paper proposes a method to evaluate the influences of bike-sharing on BAcc and to perform the method on a real-world case study in Beijing. It is found that bike-sharing has a boosting effect on BAcc, and the increased rate of BAcc is significantly affected by bicycling frequency and shared-bike availability. A case study in Beijing utilizing geo-location data collected from two major bike-sharing companies (OFO and Mo-bike) illustrates the significance of the impact of bike-sharing on BAcc and the necessity to include bike-sharing in the measurement of BAcc. Besides, the case study shows BAcc around the transit station is better than that over the whole area. Given that bicycling feeds transit, this research lays the foundation for analyzing the combination of bike-sharing and transit from the perspective of accessibility and can further support transportation planning.},

The changes are largely driven by the emerging shared-mobility services and the travel behavior of the younger generations. This study builds on an investigation of Millennials', Gen Xers' and Baby Boomers' bike sharing ridership in New York City. This study examines station-level bike share use focusing on whether and how the effects of land-use and built environment vary across different population segments. Using New York's Citi Bike system data, we develop zero-inflated negative binominal models to estimate hourly trip productions at stations for five age cohorts: younger Millennials (born 1995 to 2000), mid Millennials (1989 to 1994), older Millennials (born 1979 to 1988), Generation Xers (born 1965 to 1978), and Baby Boomers (born 1946 to 1964). Consistent with the literature, our results suggest that weather related variables, land-use and built environment characteristics have significant effects on the overall bike sharing usage. Our findings also reveal variations across age cohorts. For example, intersection density is positively related to younger Millennials' bike share trip production. However, this factor is not statistically significant for other age groups. Our findings provide valuable insights for planners and policy-makers, and set the basis for improving the understanding of cohort differences in bike sharing demand.},

  abstract = {Bike-sharing is one of the rapidly growing transport services around the world. This study aims to identify the factors that affect gender differences in bike share ridership. Using data from New York City's Citi Bike Share system, we investigate the environmental correlates of bike share usage for males and females. We also model the influences of bicycle facilities, land use factors, and public transit services on the share of trip arrivals made by females. The results suggest that the environmental correlates of bike share usage for males and females are broadly similar. However, the estimated magnitudes suggest that our variables of interest may influence males and females differently. For example, installing more bicycle racks are positively associated with bike share ridership for both genders. We further find that this factor affects women more than men. Specifically, a 1\% increase in the number of bicycle racks is correlated with a 1.18\% increment in the share of trips arrivals made by women. The findings can be used to assess the effectiveness of future infrastructure investments aimed at minimizing the gender gap in bike share usage. The findings also offer valuable insights into the ways of increasing the overall bike share ridership, thereby promoting local bicycling culture.},

The number of trips to and from each of the 116 bike share stations operating in 2011 was obtained from Nice Ride Minnesota. Data for independent variables included in the proposed models come from a variety of sources, including the 2010 U.S. Census; the Metropolitan Council, a regional planning agency; and the Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. Log-linear and negative binomial regression models are used to evaluate the marginal effects of these factors on average daily station trips. The models have high goodness of fit, and each of 13 independent variables is significant at the 10\% level or higher. The number of trips at Nice Ride stations is associated with neighborhood sociodemographics (i.e.,~age and race), proximity to the central business district, proximity to water, accessibility to trails, distance to other bike share stations, and measures of economic activity. Analysts can use these results to optimize bike share operations, locate new stations, and evaluate the potential of new bike share programs.},

Recent research into the patterns of use by members across heterogeneous neighborhoods indicates that neighborhood characteristics as well as built environment characteristics may be associated with use. We use 2017 data on trips taken by 30-day and annual members of the Nice Ride Bike Share System in Minneapolis-St. Paul and examine the associations between user behavior and socio-demographic characteristics at the Census block group (CBG) level where members live. We estimate linear mixed-effects models and multinomial logistic models to analyze the associations of neighborhood socio-demographic characteristics with, respectively, (1) the frequency and duration of weekday and weekend trips by members and (2) the temporal and spatial patterns of their trips. Our results show that, after controlling for station accessibility, nearby bike infrastructure, the built environment, gender, and age, members who reside in minority-concentrated and lower socio-economic status (SES) neighborhoods use bike share more frequently, take trips at more varied times-of-day and across days-of-week, and have more frequently-used origin-destination pairs of stations. A limitation of our analysis is that patterns of use of casual users are not investigated. Our findings have implications for efforts to serve members in neighborhoods with higher concentrations of minorities and residents of lower SES and illustrate the need for more detailed surveys of members to obtain additional information about individual characteristics associated with behaviors of bike share users.},

  abstract = {As the number of bike share programs across the world has grown, studies of bike programs and operations have proliferated. Most empirical studies of bike share demand have included analyses of station use while a limited number of studies have investigated member behavior. Moreover, a limitation of this research is that the most research designs have been cross-sectional and therefore unable to establish causality. To address this limitation, we employ a quasi-experimental, difference-in-difference modeling approach using a six-year panel data set of members' bike share trips from 2010 to 2015 in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota. This research design takes advantage of changes in the bike share network over time to establish treatment and control groups and test the significance of effects of changes in accessibility on the frequency of individual member's use of bike share. Improvements in accessibility are measured as a reduction in distance to stations resulting from placement of new stations or relocation of old stations. We find a significant negative impact of distance on the frequency of use and that the effects of increasing bike share accessibility are larger in areas with denser bike share services. Specifically, members for whom access improved (i.e., distance decreased) were significantly more likely to increase the frequency of use than members for whom access remained the same. Moreover, by developing different models, we show the effects of distance are heterogeneous and vary with different built environment contexts. Members who live in areas with higher population density and a higher percentage of retail land use tended to increase their bike share use more. Our results indicate that improvements in physical accessibility may not result in practically meaningful changes in the frequency of use in all cases and imply that multi-faceted strategies for increasing use may be needed.},

However, these models are inadequate in informing health resource allocation work due to their inappropriate assumption of healthcare demand. For the purpose of effective healthcare resource planning, this article proposes a three-step floating catchment area (3SFCA) method to minimize the healthcare-demand overestimation problem. Specifically, a spatial impedance-based competition scheme is incorporated into the enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method to account for a reasonable model of healthcare supply and demand. A case study of spatial access to primary care physicians along the Austin\textendash San Antonio corridor area in central Texas showed that the proposed method effectively minimizes the overestimation of healthcare demand and reflects a more balanced geographic pattern of spatial access than E2SFCA. In addition, by using an adjusted spatial access index, the 3SFCA method indicates strong potential for identifying health professional shortage areas. The study concludes that 3SFCA is a promising method to provide health professionals and decision makers with useful healthcare accessibility information.},

Even though bikeshare systems generate a wealth of data about bicycle checkout and check-in locations and times at docking stations, virtually nothing is known about routes and activities undertaken between checkout and check-in. Such information could greatly enhance expansion of bikeshare systems, placement of new docking stations, and location of new bike lanes and paths. In pursuit of such information, the District Department of Transportation, Washington, D.C., placed GPS trackers on 94 Capital Bikeshare (CaBi) bikes in the spring of 2015. On the basis of these data, this geographic information system analysis distinguished riders by type of CaBi membership, identified popular routes, analyzed bicycle infrastructure use, and examined stops and dwelling times at places of interest. Results showed strong differences in trip attributes between types of membership. Trips taken by short-term users were longer in distance, slower than long-term users' trips, and concentrated in and around the National Mall, whereas long-term users' trips were concentrated in mixed-use neighborhoods. Short-term users rode 12\% of their miles on dedicated bicycle infrastructure, 61\% in parks, and 27\% on roadways with motorized traffic, whereas for long-term members the percentages were 33\%, 17\%, and 50\%, respectively. On the basis of the routes taken in this study, potential locations were recommended for bicycle infrastructure improvements and new bikeshare stations.},

  abstract = {The impacts of active transportation planning on equity are often overlooked, potentially leading to disparities in who receives benefits of infrastructure investment. This study examined income inequalities in spatial access to bicycling infrastructure in three mid-sized Canadian cities: Victoria and Kelowna (British Columbia), and Halifax (Nova Scotia), using non-spatial and spatial methods. We compiled municipal bicycling infrastructure data and calculated access to bicycling infrastructure (m/km2) for dissemination areas (DAs) within each city. We analyzed trends in access across median household income quintiles, and characterized spatial patterns using a local measure of spatial autocorrelation. DAs in Kelowna (n\,=\,168) had the greatest access to infrastructure (median infrastructure = 2,915\,m/km2), followed by Victoria (n\,=\,386 DAs; median = 2,157\,m/km2), and Halifax (n\,=\,312 DAs; median = 0\,m/km2). Lower income areas in Victoria and Kelowna had greater access to infrastructure compared with higher income areas. The majority of DAs in Halifax had no infrastructure (59\%), consistent across income quintiles. Spatial pattern analysis identified clusters of low income areas with poor access in each city, which may be targets for strategic, equitable investment. Although in many cities bicycling infrastructure planning is not driven by equity considerations, there is increasing political pressure to ensure equitable access to safe bicycling. Measuring and mapping trends in access to transportation resources from an equity perspective are requisite steps in the pathway toward healthy, sustainable cities for all.},

While substantial research focuses on characteristics of public bike share members, it often overlooks their intensity of use which may relate more directly to transport and health gains. In this study we link system data with member survey data to characterize ``super-users'' of Vancouver's public bike share system. We used system data from September 1, 2016\textendash August 31, 2017 to calculate member-specific trip rates (trips/month). We linked system data to demographic and travel data for members who completed an online survey in 2017 (1232 members who had made 89,945 trips). We defined super-users as those who made 20 or more trips/month. We used a logistic regression to model demographic and travel characteristics associated with super-users as compared to regular users. Of the 1232 members, 204 were super-users. Super-users made 47\% of the trips and had a median trip rate of 29.3 trips/month. In adjusted models, super-users were more likely to be young, male, have household incomes below \$75,000, and live and work near bike share docking stations. Super-users had fewer transportation options than regular users, with lower odds of having a personal bike or car share membership. Amongst members, we found a distinct demographic profile for super-users relative to regular users, suggesting that usage is an important consideration when quantifying transport and health gains, and the resulting equity implications of public bike share programs.},

  abstract = {The sustainability of bikesharing systems depends on the bicycle network connectivity and accessibility. However, studies of bike lane infrastructure investment impacts on bikesharing ridership have been limited to station-level ridership to support bikeshare operators' resource allocation decisions. City planning agencies also need to forecast and analyze bikeshare demand in order to make investment decisions of bike facilities over time. To measure the marginal effect of building bike lanes on bikeshare demand at a network-wide level over time, an autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) model with autoregressive (AR) disturbance is proposed to capture system-wide bike ridership. The model is applied to investigate the relationship between bikeshare average daily trip counts and the total length of bike lanes in New York City (NYC) regardless of specific locations. Our results show that the installation of one additional mile of bike lanes in NYC led to an average increase of 102 bikesharing daily trips. Spatial heterogeneity is addressed through two market segments by borough (Manhattan vs. Non-Manhattan), which indicates that the improvement of bike lanes had a significant impact on bikesharing ridership in Manhattan, generating 285 more trips with one mile of bike lane built in Manhattan, but was not as effective outside of Manhattan. In addition, model results show that there were 135 and 13 more trips generated per day when one more bikesharing sharing station was added in Manhattan and Non-Manhattan, respectively. The marginal effect could vary due to the specific implemented location of a bike lane. We demonstrate that this model, as opposed to the previous studies in the literature developed at the station-level, can provide new insights into system-level causality and temporal lag characteristics. When considering whether a city agency should install a set of bike lanes immediately or to stage them over multiple weeks, the ``discount rate'' for ridership benefits is estimated via a proposed model for different types of investment. The results of investment scenario analysis show that there is a higher effective ``discount rate'' for ridership benefits from front-loading all of the investment.},

  abstract = {Many countries have implemented public bike systems to promote sustainable public transportation. Despite the rapid development of such systems, few studies have investigated how built environment factors affect the use of public bikes at station level using trip data, taking account of the spatial correlation between nearby stations. Built environment factors are strongly associated with travel demand and play an important role in the success of public bike systems. Using trip data from Zhongshan's public bike system, this paper employed a multiple linear regression model to examine the influence of built environment variables on trip demand as well as on the ratio of demand to supply (D/S) at bike stations. It also considered the spatial correlations of PBS usage between nearby stations, using the spatial weighted matrix. These built environment variables mainly refer to station attributes and accessibility, cycling infrastructure, public transport facilities, and land use characteristics. Generally, we found that both trip demand and the ratio of demand to supply at bike stations were positively influenced by population density, length of bike lanes and branch roads, and diverse land-use types near the station, and were negatively influenced by the distance to city center and the number of other nearby stations. However, public transport facilities do not show a significant impact on both demand and D/S at stations, which might be attributed to local modal split. We also found that the PBS usage at stations is positively associated with usage at nearby stations. Model results also suggest that adding a new station (with empty capacity) within a 300m catchment of a station to share the capacity of the bike station can improve the demand-supply ratio at the station. Referring to both trip demand models and D/S models, regression fits were quite strong with larger R2 for weekdays than for weekends and holidays, and for morning and evening peak hours than for off-peak hours. These quantitative analyses and findings can be beneficial to urban planners and operators to improve the demand and turnover of public bikes at bike stations, and to expand or build public bike systems in the future.},

At the end of 2016, more than 430 bike-sharing programs and nearly 2.3 million bikes were available to the public around the world. In the United States, 123 million trips have been made using shared bikes since 2010. In 2017, the number of trips made using shared bikes has reached 35 million, which is 25\% higher than that of 2016. As an increasingly popular mode of transportation, bike-sharing systems are designed for short-distance trips, which not only improves the efficiency of short-distance travels but also alleviates traffic congestion and air pollution. In addition, interests in bike-sharing systems have been fueled by several cities, including Washington DC, where bike share has quickly become a convenient and popular transportation option. Feasibility is the first to study for parties considering implementing a bike-sharing system, detailed information such as the location of stations, number of shared bikes and especially the appropriate size of catchment area should be estimated precisely by system planners. Afterwards, with such information reasonable policies can be made to ensure the operational efficiency of system and maximize system-wide ridership. However, little information is available on what size of an appropriate catchment area should be used. Due to its simplicity in application, direct demand model is gaining more attention in demand forecasting. In this study, direct demand models were used to explore the best catchment area of the bike-sharing stations in Chicago, USA. In order to find out the best catchment area, multiple radii distance range from 200 m to 800 m were established around stations in the system. Results indicated that model fitting results do not vary among different catchment areas. Thus, for purpose of completing their studies, whatever catchment area is readily available or calculated can be used by direct demand modelers. And more attention should be paid by researchers to explore the appropriate boundaries in the future.},

  abstract = {As a pinnacle of green transportation with transit attributes, bikesharing has become particularly popular since the mid-2000s. Two crucial questions for the success of bikesharing adoption are how many riders can bikesharing attract, and what influences its effectiveness. To shed light on answers to these questions, this paper models the impacts of urban features and system characteristics on bikesharing daily use and turnover rate, using data constructed on 69 bikesharing systems in China. Prior to modeling, we provide an overview of bikesharing adoption in China, describing why they have been adopted, how they have matured, and how they have expanded. Results from data regression and comparison indicate that bikesharing ridership and turnover rate tend to increase with urban population, government expenditure, the number of bikesharing members and docking stations, whilst the number of public bikes shows significant but adverse signs in impacting bikesharing ridership and turnover rate. Data comparison shows that, to pursue an ideal bikesharing turnover rate in most Chinese cities, the bike-member (supply-demand) ratio should be better controlled within 0.2. Moreover, this study suggests that personal credit cards (allowing bikesharing members to pay ``personal credit'' rather than money if they do not return public bikes within the free use hours) and universal cards (integrating bikesharing systems into other urban transit systems through the use of a rechargeable smart card that can cover a range of payments and trips) can significantly raise bikesharing daily use and turnover rate. We recommend that bikesharing operators and transit agencies take the supply-demand thresholds and the adoption of personal credit cards and universal cards into consideration in the future bikesharing operation and development policy.},
